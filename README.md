# W266 Automated Essay Scoring Final Project

### Abstract: 

Our project aims to develop AES by using BERT base and BERT-LSTM models in order to assess whether an RNN layer is needed for an effective two-stage learning framework. We found that our BERT base model is competitive to the original TSLF-1 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07744v2.pdf). On another note, our implementation of clique-based coherence based on BERTâ€™s sentence pairing feature was ineffective in capturing coherence of longer passages. Overall, we found that TSLF-ALL demonstrated robustness with small sample sizes and adversarial samples.
