# W266 Automated Essay Scoring Final Project
## Group Members: Sharon Wu, Candice Sener, Vish Pillai

Abstract: 

Automated essay scoring has not only been effective in decreasing the time to assess an essay but also to assess essays more fairly in standardized tests. This project aims to develop AES by using BERT and LSTM. By utilizing the self-attention framework, we observed whether it can improve the two-stage learning framework. TSLF-ALL was compared to TSLF-1 BERT and TSLF-2, and we found that TSLF-ALL demonstrated the highest effectiveness and robustness when the sample sizes were small.
